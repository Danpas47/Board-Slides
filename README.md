# Board-Slides
Over this project, i will analyze several DataFrames and create several visualizations to answer these questions:

*What cuisines does FoodWheel offer? 
*Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?
*How has the average order amount changed over time? What does this say about the trajectory of the company?
*How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months? 
*What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?
